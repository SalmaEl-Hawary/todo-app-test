# Background and Motivation
We need a very simple Todo List app using React.js (Next.js) with Tailwind UI styling. Node.js backend is optional; the MVP can work fully client-side with localStorage persistence. The goal is to quickly ship a minimal, clean, and responsive todo app.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Keep scope minimal: add todo, toggle complete, delete.
- Ensure Tailwind is properly configured and base styles loaded.
- Handle client-only persistence (localStorage) with SSR-safe hydration.
- Keep components small and testable; use TDD where feasible for core behaviors.
- Optional API: simple Next.js route with in-memory store to demonstrate Node.js usage.

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Initialize Next.js app with Tailwind CSS
   - Success: `npm run dev` serves a page with Tailwind styles applied.
2. Set up Tailwind UI base styles and config
   - Success: Typography and forms styles available; basic layout looks correct.
3. Implement minimal Todo UI: add, toggle, delete
   - Success: User can add items, mark complete, and delete; UI updates immediately.
4. Add localStorage persistence and hydration
   - Success: Refreshing the page preserves todos; no SSR hydration warnings.
5. Add basic component tests with React Testing Library
   - Success: Tests cover add/toggle/delete and persistence logic.
6. Optional: Implement Next.js API routes for todos (in-memory)
   - Success: `/api/todos` supports GET/POST/DELETE; UI can switch to API mode.
7. Wire simple page styling with Tailwind UI components
   - Success: Clean layout using Tailwind UI patterns; accessible and responsive.
8. Write concise README with run scripts
   - Success: Clear instructions to install, run, test.

# Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Verified production build and tests pass (4/4).
- Attempted to start dev server and probe `http://localhost:3000`. If it does not auto-start in this environment, run locally: `cd web && npm run dev`.
- Next: User to open the app in a browser and check DevTools Console for any errors.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Please share any browser console errors or terminal output from `npm run dev` so I can fix promptly.

# Lessons
- Include helpful debug info in output where appropriate.
- Always read files before editing them.
- If vulnerabilities appear during install, run `npm audit` and report.
- Ask before using git `-force` operations.
